Solving N-Queen problem using Genetic Algorithm

The aim of N-Queens Problem is to place N queens on an N x N chessboard, in a way so that no queen is in conflict with the others.

## Terminology
- Gene:  An individual is characterized by a set of variables
- Chromosome: Genes are joined into a string to form a Chromosome (solution). A chromosome is a set of parameters which define a proposed solution to the problem that the genetic algorithm is trying to solve
- Population: The set of all solutions
- Fitness Function: Pairs of non-attacking queens (say for N=8, Fmax= 8C2 = 8*7/2 = 28)
- Crossover: Also called recombination, is a genetic operator used to combine the genetic information of two parents to generate new offspring
- Mutation: It alters one or more gene values in a chromosome from its initial state
